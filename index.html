        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current college student, majoring in psychology. I choose this major because I think its content is really interesting. Another reason I choose this major is because there is someone in my family who suffer from depression and anxiety. Seeing the person suffer and do not know how to deal with his condition, it is heart-breaking. The first time that I got in touch with psychology was in high school, junior year. I took the class as an elective and do not expect myself to have interest in it. Within a few weeks of class, I found out that the lessons are really interesting and very attracting. For the next couple of weeks, my intention to be in this class is very high. I still can remember that my teacher would do a lot of fun activities in class, so they the students can have a better understanding of the textbook materials. Because of all the activities that the teacher provided in class, I understood the knowledge in a very fun and easy way. The excitement of being in the psychology class really surprise me but did not really think about it too much.  <br><br>

        In senior year, it is time to think about what I should be majoring in college. At first, I wanted to major in art because I have been learning how to draw and paint since I was a girl, and have a lot in interest in art. As time when by, I had a feeling that I did not follow my heart. Later on, all I can think about is the concept of psychology and the reason why it is so attractive. I also asked myself that it is really the materials that interest you or it is just the environment that created by the teacher that interested me. To finally decided to be majoring in psychology, I still need a little push. The day that I found out that someone in the family is suffering from mental health, I have eager of wanting to know what cause him to be feel what his feeling. After that day, I decided to major in psychology. I told my parents about how I think about psychology and why I like it, what they told me is exactly what I need. Even thought they are confuse about why I suddenly changed from wanting to major in art to psychology but they did not ask much. My parents also show their support to what I want to do, but they also give me suggestion about my choices. And now I am a student in University of California Riverside majoring in psychology.<br><br>

        During freshman year in UCR, I participated in four different researches within the field of psychology, all the reaches are conducted by professors in the psychology department. All the researches are about how a factor affects an independent's life habits, self-impression, and self-confidence. While participating in the researches, I learned a lot about how to collect data, different ways to collect data, and how to interpret the data that was collected. I also have a very good understanding of the basic materials in the different field of psychology.  I know how different research methods work and how to use them to their best performance.
